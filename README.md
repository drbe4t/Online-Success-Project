# Online Succesful Student Page for UVU's Office of Teaching and Learning

I work as a video producer and we had an external page being used for a page to talk about how you can be a succesful online student.  I had did the four tip videos for this project and  they needed an updated page so I decided to take a leap of faith and ask if I could code. They welcomed it and so my first [Bulma project](bulma.io) was born.

It took some time to figure out how to get everything set-up and it's not quite perfect but it was a great project to learn Bulma. Which I've come to really enjoy.
I believe I'll be updating it every once in awhile.
